# travel-dataset-analysis
the dataset is of logistics and it has single trip in a row and in columns it has category, travelid, shipperid, revenue and many more. the analysis contains different aspect of the travel dataset. I tried to get some important insights like total trips, how many deadhead miles travelled, trend in revenue and cost with the time, etc.
